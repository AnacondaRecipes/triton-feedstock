  summary: Development repository for the Triton language and compiler
  description: |
    This is the development repository of Triton, a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom Deep-Learning primitives.
    The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment to write fast code at higher productivity than CUDA, but also with higher flexibility than other existing DSLs.
