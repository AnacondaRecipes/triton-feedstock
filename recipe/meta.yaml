# Note that PyTorch is a test dependency here, and Triton is a dependency of (the CUDA variant of) PyTorch.
# So, you need to build Triton without running the tests (`conda build --no-test`), then build PyTorch, then run these tests.
test:
  imports:
    - triton
    - triton._C.libtriton
  requires:
    - pip
    - pytest
    - scipy
    - pytorch=*=*cuda*
  source_files:
    - python/test
  commands:
    - pip check
    # test suite essentially depends on availability of a physical GPU,
    # see https://github.com/openai/triton/issues/466;
    # run a test that does not require a GPU but checks
    # if triton.compile() works
    - pytest -v python/test/unit/tools/test_aot.py::test_ttgir_to_ptx
    # Here is a list of current test failures and reasoning why they're ok:
    #
    # test_dummy_backend                    - looks like it's using CUDA instead of CPU backend for this test, for some reason. We don't need to use the CPU backend anyway.
    # IndexError: map::at errors            - known issue for T4 GPUs https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/issues/3787
    # out of resource: shared memory errors - fine, just platform resource is less than expected
    # test_print[device_print_large-int32]  - assert False - looks like a print output error, works fine for other data types, should be ok
    # test_compile_in_forked_subproc        - AssertionError: assert 1 == 0 - also an IndexError: map::at output (shown in the stderr output)
    #
    # In general, the more important tests are the PyTorch tests. This package only supports PyTorch. See text at the top of the recipe.
    #
    # the test_performance tests are broken for compute capability 7.x, which applies to our current build instances.
    # test_device_backend is also broken, attempting to import from triton.common which was removed.
    # Skipping python/test/unit tests due to configuration conflict with duplicate --device parameter (there's probably a different
    # way around this, but for now skipping is sufficient to reach the more interesting tests).

  summary: Development repository for the Triton language and compiler
  description: |
    This is the development repository of Triton, a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom Deep-Learning primitives.
    The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment to write fast code at higher productivity than CUDA, but also with higher flexibility than other existing DSLs.
